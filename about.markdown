Hi There, my name is Kerrigan and I've been playing games for as 
long as I've been a mostly functioning human creature. I hope to use 
this blog as a comprehensive home for my reviews and as a place where 
I can share my thoughts on games with you. 

I will also be sharing development of my own personal TTRPG game Ara as well as the resources you'll need to run it yourself. You can find more about that at [World of Ara](/world_of_ara)
